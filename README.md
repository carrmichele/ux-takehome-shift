## Your Mission

Build a web page with an input box that uses the node server to deliver a
filesystem autocomplete experience similar to what you get when typing a query into Google.com.

-I used Google Places API for the autocomplete functionality.

-In the future I would add Shift's API to allow Google Maps to display Shift cars for sale near a location that a user searches.

-This project was completed as part of the takehome project for Shift.

## Technologies Used:
